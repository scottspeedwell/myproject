text-transform: capitalize turns the first letter of every word into uppercase.
text-transform: uppercase turns everything into uppercase.
text-transform: lowercase turns everything into lowercase.
text-transform: none I’ll leave for you to work 


box-shadow: 5px 5px 3px 1px #999
The first value is the horizontal offset - how far the shadow is nudged to the right (or left if it’s negative)
The second value is the vertical offset - how far the shadow is nudged downwards (or upwards if it’s negative)
The third value is the blur radius - the higher the value the less sharp the shadow. (“0” being absolutely sharp). This is optional - omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.
The fourth value is the spread distance - the higher the value, the larger the shadow (“0” being the inherited size of the box). This is also optional - omitting it is equivalent of setting “0”.
The fifth value is a color. That’s optional, too.


text-shadow: -2px 2px 2px #999;
Similarly to box-shadow:
The first value is the horizontal offset
The second value is the vertical offset
The third value is the blur radius (optional)
The fourth value is the color (optional, although omitting this will make the shadow the same color as the text itself)

Note that there is no spread distance or inset option for text-shadow
